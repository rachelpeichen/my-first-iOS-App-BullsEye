## :dart: My First iOS and SwiftUI App: BullsEye

This project is the implement of the online course provided by raywenderlich.com :point_right:
[Your First iOS and SwiftUI App](https://www.raywenderlich.com/4919757-your-first-ios-and-swiftui-app)

_**This course is designed for people who don't have any Swift or iOS developing experiences before.**_

As a programming begineer, I don't have any prior iOS knowledge, but this course walks me through building an app from zero to finish.

**The instructor lectures in a clear way**, so it's suitable for programming newbies like me:baby:. 

After finished this project, I gained a sense of accomplishment, and it also inpsire me to learn more about iOS development since it's really interested!

Here are some of the views of the App that I build through this course, and I also demo it on my iPhoneXR (the demo video is also uploaded to Github)

_**Notes: the course are taught in older version (Swift 5, iOS 13, Xcode 11); my development environment is the latest (Swift5.1, iOS 14, Xcode 12.2 but it can work without problems.:+1:**_
